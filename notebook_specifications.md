## 2. Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations

This section outlines the key mathematical concepts and formulas used in the lab.

**2.1 Probability of Default (PD):**

The Probability of Default (PD) represents the likelihood that a borrower will fail to meet their debt obligations within a specified time horizon. It is a crucial parameter in credit risk management.

**2.2 Through-The-Cycle (TTC) PD:**

TTC PD represents the average probability of default for a given rating grade over a long period, ideally spanning multiple economic cycles.

**2.3 Point-In-Time (PIT) PD:**

PIT PD is the probability of default at a specific point in time, considering current macroeconomic conditions.  It is dynamically adjusted based on factors like GDP growth, unemployment rate, and inflation.

**2.4 Brier Score:**

The Brier score measures the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. It quantifies the difference between predicted probabilities and actual outcomes. The Brier Score is calculated as:

$$BS = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}(f_i - o_i)^2$$

Where:

*   $N$ is the number of predictions.
*   $f_i$ is the forecast probability of event $i$.
*   $o_i$ is the actual outcome of event $i$ (0 if the event did not occur, 1 if the event occurred).
    * A lower Brier score indicates better calibration.

**2.5 Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve and Area Under the Curve (AUC):**

The ROC curve plots the true positive rate (sensitivity) against the false positive rate (1 - specificity) at various threshold settings. AUC represents the area under the ROC curve and measures the model's ability to discriminate between defaulting and non-defaulting obligors.  An AUC of 1.0 represents perfect discrimination, while an AUC of 0.5 indicates performance no better than random chance.

**2.6 Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) Statistic:**

The KS statistic measures the maximum difference between the cumulative distribution functions of predicted PDs for defaulted and non-defaulted obligors. It quantifies the model's discriminatory power.

**2.7 Population Stability Index (PSI):**

PSI measures the change in the distribution of a characteristic (e.g., rating grade, predicted PD) between two time periods (e.g., training window and current quarter). It helps assess the stability of the portfolio and the model.

$$PSI = \sum_{i=1}^{N} (Actual\%_i - Expected\%_i) \cdot ln(\frac{Actual\%_i}{Expected\%_i})$$

Where:

*   $N$ is the number of categories.
*   $Actual\%_i$ is the percentage of observations in category $i$ in the current period.
*   $Expected\%_i$ is the percentage of observations in category $i$ in the baseline period.

    * A PSI value greater than 0.25 typically indicates a significant shift in the distribution.
